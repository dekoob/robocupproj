% === Section 1. Static knowledge ===

% Static course-knowledge facts — these never change during a simulation run.
% Numbers tuned so that 10 rounds produce visible goals and kicks on a 100x50 grid:
%   move_step(5) so players cover ground quickly; stamina_init(100) with costs 5/10
%   so each player can make ~20 moves or ~10 kicks before tiring.

% field(+Size) — describes the playing field dimensions as size(Width, Height)
field(size(100, 50)).

% goal_position(+Team, +Rect) — rect(X1,Y1,X2,Y2) bounds of each team's goal opening.
%   Goal is on the field edge (x=0 / x=100), y in [20,30] — like real football.
goal_position(team1, rect(0, 20, 0, 30)).    % team1 goal: left edge, y in [20,30]
goal_position(team2, rect(100, 20, 100, 30)). % team2 goal: right edge, y in [20,30]

% gk_zone_depth(+D) — how far in front of the goal the goalkeeper may patrol.
%   Analogous to a penalty/goal area. GK chases loose balls within this zone;
%   returns to goal center if ball is outside it.
gk_zone_depth(10).

% kick_range(+R) — maximum Manhattan distance at which a player can kick the ball.
%   Set to 50 so a player at midfield can reach either goal, and a goalkeeper can
%   clear the ball past the halfway line.
kick_range(50).

% catch_range(+R) — maximum Manhattan distance at which a goalkeeper can catch the ball.
%   Reduced to 3 so corner shots (y=20,21,29,30) can score; centre shots still saved.
catch_range(3).

% move_step(+S) — distance a player advances in one move action
move_step(5).

% stamina_init(+S) — starting stamina for every player at world setup
stamina_init(100).

% stamina_cost_move(+C) — stamina deducted per move_step action
stamina_cost_move(5).

% stamina_cost_kick(+C) — stamina deducted per kick action
stamina_cost_kick(10).

% tackle_success_rate(+R) — probability (1-100) that a tackle attempt steals possession.
%   On success the defender gains the ball; on failure the ball goes loose at the
%   opponent's feet (contested 50/50 — both players must react next round).
tackle_success_rate(50).

% === Section 2. Dynamic world model ===

% Dynamic declarations for every mutable predicate used across all sections.
% Declared here once, centrally, to avoid dependency cycles.

:- dynamic ball/1.          % ball(position(X,Y)) — current ball position
:- dynamic player/4.        % player(Team, Role, position(X,Y), Stamina)
:- dynamic score/2.         % score(Team, N) — current score for Team
:- dynamic possession/2.    % possession(Team, Role) — who holds the ball; possession(none,none) = loose
:- dynamic first_mover/1.   % first_mover(Team) — which team acts first this round
:- dynamic current_state/3. % current_state(Team, Role, State) — FSM state per player
:- dynamic metric/3.        % metric(kicks|catches|goals, Team, N) — counters

% TODO (other sections) — world initialisation (setup_world/0) goes in Section 3.

% === Section 3. CSP initial formation ===

% Sensed helper predicates — side-effect-free queries on ball/1, player/4,
% possession/2 and the static range facts.  All use Manhattan distance.
%
% Arity convention used by eval_cond/3:

%   (X in [50,100]).  Both teams may claim X=50 — this is intentional and mirrors
%   a contested centre-line; it means ball_in_own_half/1 can succeed for BOTH teams
%   when the ball is exactly on the halfway line.
